- **Monitoring Tools**: Built-in performance monitoring and validation

## Quick Start

```python
from scripts.bracon_ash_predictor import BraconAshPredictor

# Initialize predictor
predictor = BraconAshPredictor()

# Load your data
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_excel("your_data.xlsx")

# Make predictions
results = predictor.predict(data)
print(f"Average prediction: {results['predicted_generation_kwh'].mean():.2f} kWh")
```
